appicns
=======

.app.icns is a for-fun project by [Andrew](http://twitter.com/andrevvm) & [Kara](http://kara-z.com).

Installation
------------

We use a nice piece of software called [CandyBar](http://panic.com/candybar) to manage our icons. Just open up the iContainer file and click 'Use these icons' for easiest installation.

Some icons, like iCal, require manual installation.
